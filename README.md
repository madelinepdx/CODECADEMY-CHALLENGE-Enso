Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

Overview:
This project involved a series of open-ended requirements to complete a flexbox layout for a company's homepage (real or imagined).
I was able to decide exactly what content to include for this company, as long as it included:

- A title and logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company
- A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company
- A section describing some of the companyâ€™s employees or teammates.
- Flexbox styling for layout
